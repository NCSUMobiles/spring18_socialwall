Installation Instructions

We tried to get an exe working, but there were some issues with game speed and corrupted files. Instead, here are instructions to pull the directory and build it yourself.

Pull down the directory and open it in a Unity Editor. Find the Scenes directory and open the SolarSystem.unity file. This will open our project and allow you to play around with it. Run it in the editor to see it in action.

To build an exe, you will need to click File/BuildSettings. This will allow you to name the project before building it. Once it is done building, you will have an exe that will run the project. Display 1 will be set to the wall scene and display 2 will be set to the floor scene.
