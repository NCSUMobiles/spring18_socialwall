Visula Interfaces for Mobile Devices - Spring 2018 - Team : Social Wall

# Cosmic Explorer
Cosmic Explorer aims to engage young visitors and immerse them in an interactive, intuitive, and exciting world where they will learn to express their curiosity and explore the solar system through the wonder of play!

While motion tracking is the ideal way to play, this project also works with a mouse and keyboard.

# Description

The Durham Museum of Life and Science is looking for an interactive exhibit to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. This exhibit would be projected onto both an open wall and a section of the floor to create an immersive experience aimed at kids around the age of seven. We divided our project into two sections: the wall scene and the floor scene. The floor scene shows a top-down display of the solar system. The planets move relative to their actual speeds around the sun, with one Earth year taking about 7 seconds. 
The wall scene is where the interactions take place. This will show all 8 of the planets scaled up and stationary around the sun. Using the motion tracking, a player can select a planet by hovering over it for 1.5 seconds. After a planet has been selected, the floor scene will shift to a zoom-in of the planet. As all this is happening, there are also some objects that will spawn and fly around the space. These include a comet, an asteroid, an astronaut, a space ship, and a Tesla Roadster. If the player hovers over these, a unique sound will play.


# Controls for Mouse and Keyboard
Click and drag the particle trail in the middle of the screen. This represents a hand and is used to interact with everything. 

Press *space* to create another hand. These will have a randomized color, but will work the same way as the default hand.

Press *backspace* to toggle between the 3D planet zoom-in and the illustrator's rendition of the planet zoom with easter eggs.

# Future Work
* Improve the motion tracking to be more stable and support more skeletons
* Along with motion tracking, add star trails behind hands and feet.
* Gestures
* Implementing easter egg interactions for each planet (Curiosity Rover is moving around on Mars, ISS orbiting Earth, etc.)
* Adding in a way to express information about the planets so that kids learn as they play.
* Fine-tune textures so some planets donâ€™t look as flat (Jupiter, Saturn)
