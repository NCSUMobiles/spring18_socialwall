# Cosmic Explorer
Cosmic Explorer aims to engage young visitors and immerse them in an interactive, intuitive, and exciting world where they will learn to express their curiosity and explore the solar system through the wonder of play!

While motion tracking is the ideal way to play, this project also works with a mouse and keyboard.

# Description



# Controls for Mouse and Keyboard
Click and drag the particle trail in the middle of the screen. This represents a hand and is used to interact with everything. 

Press *space* to create another hand. These will have a randomized color, but will work the same way as the default hand.

Press *backspace* to toggle between the 3D planet zoom-in and the illustrator's rendition of the planet zoom with easter eggs.
